    <h1>WHAT IS ART?</h1>
    <p><b>This site is a meditation on the age old question <em><b>What is Art?</b></em> by looking at what the <b>artists</b> themselves have told us about what it is that they do. There are art historians and critics that have written extensively about art's role both in culture and society for centuries. Each of them looking at the artworks and attempting to define them and the artists who created them. But what of the artists themselves? What do  they have to say about the <em>meaning</em> of their work, the <em>process</em> of being an artist, and what art reveals to us about the human experience.</b></p>

        <div class="container1"><p><b>&#x22;The greatest artist does not have any concept which a single piece of marble does not itself contain within its excess, though only a hand that obeys the intellect can discover it.&#x22;</b> Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni (March 6, 1475-February 18, 1564) Republic of Florence, present-day Tuscany, Italy</p>
 <p>We can all imagine Michelangelo in his various studios in <b>Bologna, Florence and Rome</b> sketching, making plans, and spending many hours carving his <em>sculptures.</em> Have you ever asked yourself <b><em>What do artists see?</em></b>
            <p>What did Michelangelo mean when he said,<b>&#x22;I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free.&#x22;</b><br> 
        <p>Here Michelangelo sounds like a poet revealing yet another layer of his creative process. Michelangelo is known around the world as a legendary visual artist, but he was also a prolific poet. In reading Michelangelo's poems we can imagine the artist drawing, painting, and sculpting poems using words as his material instead of marble or bronze to bring to life what he sees, dreams and imagines. We see a figure with a gaze. We would almost swear that it is real. We identify these sculptures as human. We detect the emotional current running through them. Is it the artist's soul we are perceiving or a synchronicity between our own <b>perceptions/projections</b> and the <em>essence</em> that the artist has imbued his work with? We often hear about <i>gifted</i> people, those who are <i>blessed with talent</i> and all the <i>divine inspiration</i> one needs to be an artist.</p>
        <p>The marvelous Michelangelo decides to bring us back down to Earth by declaring <b><em>&#x22;If you knew how much work went into it, you wouldn't call it genius.&#x22;</em></b> Here we get a sort of rebuke and accusation from the artist that the public doesn't really understand how art is made. He points to the unglamorous aspects of art namely the labor and time it takes to produce his work. The artist reminds us that what we see is but a glimpse into the artist's process<i>&#x2D;the finished product&#x2D;</i>that much of the art's origins remain elusive. </p>
