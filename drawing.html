    <h1>Drawing</h1><br><br><br>
    
    <p><b>&#34;Drawing is a form of probing. And the first generic impulse to draw derives from the human need to search, to plot points, to place things and to place oneself. 
&#x22; John Berger, from <em>Bento's Sketchbook</em></b></p>

        <p>We all continue to have the experience, every day, especially in places like the subway, of seeing people around us yawning, coughing, blinking and squinting while we also do the same. We notice that these processes are going on without our consent or participation. We can all see in our heads an image of someone trying to stiffle a yawn and the grimacing expression on their faces as their muscles contract and they fail in stopping this force from coming through. Many artists often talk about not knowing what they are going to draw; not knowing where they are going. What they know is that they must make a move and see where the line goes.<br>
            When we read an essay or a book, we do so to understand the ideas the writer wants to get across to the reader. When an artist draws, he is accessing things from the subsconcious, the parts of ourselves that are hidden that  come to the surface when he is  experimenting with marks and lines on paper. We see not just what the drawing depicts, but also a glimpse into what the artist has discovered.<br>
            The English art critic, novelist, artist, and poet John Berger here informs us that the drawing originates outside of our sense of logic.<br><br>&#34;<em><b>There is a symbiotic desire to get closer and closer, to enter the self of what is being drawn, and, simultaneously, there is the foreknowledge of immanent distance. Such drawings aspire to be both a secret rendezvous and an au revoir! Alternately and ad infinitum.&#x22;</b></em>from <b><em>Bento's Sketchbook.</em></b><br><br>
            
            When the Polish-French artist Balthus said, <b><em>&#34;One must always draw, draw with the eyes, when one cannot draw with a pencil.&#x22;</em></b><br>
            We can imagine the artist with his eyes closed constructing his drawing with lines made of light or leaves or the geo engeneered particles being sprayed in the sky; We make a point and take those to connect the dots and produce a picture.<br><br>

        <h5>Jean-Michel Basquiat, Untitled (Just Sour), 1982, From the Schorr Family Collection.</h5>
        <p>When the American artist Jean-Michel Basquiat said, <b><em>&#34;Believe it or not, I can actually draw.&#x22;</em></b> he points to this idea that many have of drawing as only a representation of life as we see it. To draw a portrait of someone that doesn't look precisely as they do is offensive. They are expecting a clone of themselves on paper. Drawings through history that have deviated from an anatomically precise depiction have been seen as childlike and lacking in skill. Basquiat suggests to us that he not only drawing from his skill and technique, but from another source. The broken and often hurt faces in his work convey an emotional power with their stark and confrontational presence. Looking at his work I'm reminded of the horror we feel we see ourselves in a photograph that captured us grimacing with a contorted face.</p><br><br>
        
        
        <p><em><b>&#34;Sketching is almost everything. It is the painter's identity, his style, his conviction, and then color is just a gift to the drawing.&#x22; Fernando Botero</b></em><br>Here Botero tells us of drawing as a stand alone work and also a blueprint for other works like painting and suggests that painting cannot be done without it. The artist's "style" comes from the drawing he tells us not from the paint and color. The true material essence of the painting is the drawing.<br><br>  
                The French artist Paul Gauguin said,<br> <em><b>&#34;A critic at my house sees some paintings. Greatly perturbed, he asks for my drawings. My drawings! Never! They are my letters, my secrets.&#x22;</b></em> Here the artist invites us into his private world makes us aware of yet another dimension of the drawing. He lets us know that there are drawings that are not to be seen by anyone except the artist. <br><br>
                The Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti expresses the physicality involved in drawing, and the artist moving in within the unknown when he said.<br><em><b>&#34;When I make my drawings... the path traced by my pencil on the sheet of paper is, to some extent, analogous to the gesture of a man groping his way in the darkness. &#x22;</b></em> He suggests an image of an artist trying to find his way through the dark with his pencil as a kind of flashlight marking the path forward.</p>
                <p>The French artist Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres gives us his definitive statement of the importance of drawing when he said,<br> <em><b>&#34;Drawing includes three and a half quarters of the content of painting... Drawing contains everything, except the hue.&#x22;</b></em></p>
