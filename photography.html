        <p>One of the phrase we have all heard throughout our lives is &#34;Think before you speak&#33;&#x22; This statement is a recognition that the latter is possible without the former. We can all recall instances where we found ourselves thinking or saying aloud &#34;I didn't mean to say that, or I wish I hadn't said that.&#x22; It suggests to us that there are varied ways of expressing oneself and of seing things. So what did the Swiss-American  photographer and filmmaker Robert Frank mean when he said<br> <b><em>&#34;The eye should learn to listen before it looks.&#x22;</em></b><br>  
          Photography like drawing, painting, and sculpture has been used to document events like The American Civil War, commemorate significant people with portraits, and create works of art. Robert Frank directs us toward another dimension of the image making process. He suggests that photography isn't exclusively dependent on the visual. Does being a good listener make one a good photographer and artist? Frank, who turned 93 two weeks ago seems to think so, and he presents listening as a prerequesitive to seeing.<br>
            &#34;<em><b>Above all, life for a photographer cannot be a matter of indifference&#x22;</b></em><br>
            Here Frank tells us that a photographer is not merely a casual observer or recorder of events, but someone with a purpose and a commitment to a vision. One thinks of the Danish-American journalist and photographer Jacob Riis, who used photography to bring attention to social problems like slum conditions and general poverty in New York City. For Riis and many other photographers images were and continue to be another way of communicating with the public.</p><br>

            <div class="container1"><p><em><b>&#34;Sketching is almost everything. It is the painter's identity, his style, his conviction, and then color is just a gift to the drawing.&#x22; Fernando Botero</b></em><br>Here Botero tells us of drawing as a stand alone work and also a blueprint for other works like painting and suggests that painting cannot be done without it. The artist's "style" comes from the drawing he tells us not from the paint and color. The true material essence of the painting is the drawing.<br>  
                The French artist Paul Gauguin said,<br> <em><b>&#34;A critic at my house sees some paintings. Greatly perturbed, he asks for my drawings. My drawings! Never! They are my letters, my secrets.&#x22;</b></em> Here the artist invites us into his private world makes us aware of yet another dimension of the drawing. He lets us know that there are drawings that are not to be seen by anyone except the artist. <br>
                The Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti expresses the physicality involved in drawing, and the artist moving in within the unknown when he said.<br><em><b>&#34;When I make my drawings... the path traced by my pencil on the sheet of paper is, to some extent, analogous to the gesture of a man groping his way in the darkness. &#x22;</b></em> He suggests an image of an artist trying to find his way through the dark with his pencil as a kind of flashlight marking the path forward.</p>
                <p>The French artist Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres gives us his definitive statement of the importance of drawing when he said,<br> <em><b>&#34;Drawing includes three and a half quarters of the content of painting... Drawing contains everything, except the hue.&#x22;</b></em></p>
